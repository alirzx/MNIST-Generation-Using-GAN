# MNIST Generation Project

## Overview

This project aims to generate handwritten digits using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), which are commonly used for training various image processing systems.
